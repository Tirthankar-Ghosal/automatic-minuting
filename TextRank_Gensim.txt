Do you create a next different link every time (with) – have a meeting?
[PERSON27] Yes. So this Zoom link will also – <ehm> will also function the next time we <ehm> have the coffee meeting.
we can use it <ehm> like for – for all (of our meetings), so –
[PERSON27] Yes, okay, nice.
So, [PERSON27], so (??) let discuss some things, okay?
[PERSON27] So our output is ma- manually corrected minutes and manually corrected transcript.
[PERSON54] I – I – I want to know that how do you have (??)?
so <ehm>, <ehm> I will send you a link to minutes annotation, so that you can open it now.
[PERSON27] <ehm> (??) is right that Zoom is not working (for) (??).
[PERSON27] So how is it possible that some link is working and another doesn't?
(But) Zoom is like, you know, much bigger than Google meet.
[PERSON27] And especially I can hear much better with Zoom than with Google meet.
[PERSON27] Google meet.
[PERSON27] Oh, one hour, okay.
[PERSON54] But Google meet is also free for fourty minutes, but I want to (??) [PERSON27], how like <ehm> [PERSON7] <ehm> like (be have got like the paid for (??) Zoom).
Because (??) ([PERSON7] seems that) Zoom meeting link, it is (obvious) the – like <unrecognisable_speech>
[PERSON27] There are some Zooms that we prepaid, but <ehm> I'm not sure if it's a good option for lo- for our coffee m- coffee meetings.
[PERSON54] So [PERSON27], could you – could you respond to (??), like if he can (reensolve) Zoom and (then join), because in Google meet it is really difficult to hear.
So we have transcripts with really bad automatic quality, which I send to the annotator and ask him to correct the data.
[PERSON27] He creates the minutes, yes.
[PERSON27] Yes. This is mostly – it – this is what was created by [PERSON7] <ehm> within our [PROJECT1] minutes – [PROJECT1] meetings.
[PERSON54] Okay, so I would like to ask you now –
So, by this original meetings, what (??) [PERSON7] and [PERSON42] (has) created, so it is just for (reference of the annotators).
so I cannot actually say that they are worse that the min- minutes created by annotators.
It is actually a questions, because there are some drawbacks of those originnal minutes, because <ehm> they do not contain some information or they may contain something that was not discussed during the meeting.
[PERSON54] So, not all the meetings has the original minutes, right?
[PERSON27] <ehm> Yes, <ehm> we try to get original minutes from the minu- meeting organisers, but sometimes <ehm> it may be very short for example, for –
[PERSON54] <ehm> No. I want to say that (support) after the team watch them, where from (today look the) (??).
[PERSON27] This is the question we discussed today in the morning.
<ehm> So ([PERSON7]) proposes that annotators do that themselves.
so at the moment I do not have any idea hw to technically work with the variant that annotators send the data via (Github).
[PERSON7] – [PERSON7] is very much for that so that we really do that (Github) team and they can push and pull the data to the Github.
I have to say them 'Now you <ehm> write this and that – this meeting' <ehm>, I have to correct it, so I have to look if their transcript and the minutes are <ehm> okay.
[PERSON55] <ehm> Sorry to interupt you Anja, I think that [PERSON7] already decided not to include – not to <ehm> let them <parallel_talk> Yes.
[PERSON27] [PERSON55], not really, because afterwards, after that meeting, he said me many times h- that he still s- sees that it should be maybe changed.
[PERSON55] Okay, <laugh> so then we need another meeting I guess.
then we need another meeting with [PERSON7].
[PERSON55] Okay, so, [PERSON27], I – yeah I – so – so this is like you <unrecognisable_speech> to upload the minute (??) correct, so this is actually a (list) work for us.
[PERSON55] Like if the annotators up- upload the minute themselves, so –
[PERSON27] Actually I'm not really fine with that at the moment, because for me – <ehm> I should think it over and I didn't do it yet.
[PERSON55] I – I think the same [PERSON27], I absolutely agree with you.
I would not (ask) this persons to push in (Github) <parallel_talk> Yes.
[PERSON27] So probably let's – yes.
Now it's absolutely okay, that we just send them the data.
[PERSON27] So let's not think about it at the moment if possible.
[PERSON27] Aou want me to repeat why you need the alignment?
[PERSON54] Great, so, we do alignment, (??) fine, the manual (??) are done, but what is the final output?
[PERSON27] Because I think <ehm> there should be a total understand– understanding between us what do you mean.
[PERSON54] So how are we going to use the alignment in evaluation?
if you would ask [PERSON7] this question he would probably say that <ehm> (??) think about it and <ehm> make o <ehm> or invent the measure or metric for – for that.
So I've like – I – I would pick up from this (here), so the thing is that <ehm> meeting or coming up with that measure want to be that much busy.
[PERSON54] Do you think this alignment –
[PERSON54] First, alignment first, manual evaluation measure –
I think this is the (??) you should discuss in more detail with [PERSON7].
<ehm> Okay, so- suppose they does speak a scenario that we don't come up with a manual evaluation measure, before the shared task, so, what options we have.
So the options that we have is – we have the transcript, which is manually corrected, we have the minute, which is the (??),  contains the (??) summary.
And then <ehm> we (reuse) the data and we evaluate the submissions based on automatic measure.
[PERSON54] There are many automatic measures for (summarisation).
<ehm> so in summarising paper on that (??) maybe [PERSON55] also knows, none of them really works well.
[PERSON55] Well I wouldn't say none of them really works (well), I would say that they are kind of deceptive in some cases like they tch- they are very high – very high (??) –
But we add another human evaluation score, that was the point of <ehm> th- that I wrote the protocol, like try to come up with some tips.
But that human evaluation (??) should be like very subjective and (??), right?
[PERSON55] <mmhm> No, it's not very subjective, it's like –
[PERSON55] There is how most of the like evaluations are done in the community, in the literature.
Like have a summary or a text and we compare it with the reference and we have the annotators th- to compare it.
I – I – I got – I go- got the (multimission) of <ehm> the (??) meeting script, but still that is like the (??) that [PERSON7] <ehm> is targetting to achieve <ehm> would you be more objective?
[PERSON55] <ehm> Yes, I mean –
Okay, so, like –
Okay, so the thing is that if we don't come up <ehm> with the alignment based manual evaluation (??), we will do as the normally the other (energy) task (??) <ehm> entries, right?
[PERSON54] Yeah, so <parallel_talk> So – <parallel_talk> if we – if we are like – if we are not able to come up with the alignment <ehm>, if we are not able to come up with the alignment based <ehm> manual evaluation measure, –
That's – yes, okay, why not.
[PERSON27] Okay, so may I – may I summarise it, please?
[PERSON27] So <ehm> really <ehm> we want to use <ehm> alignment annotation for summarisation, this is variant A.
And in this case we follow variant B, and this is using <ehm> human evaluation like readibility and so on, not using the alignment.
[PERSON54] <mmhm> Yes. Yes, so <ehm> – so the thing is that <ehm> my <ehm> <unrecognisable_speech> before November it would be difficult to come up with the alignment (this score), so <ehm> for the (past) shared task that we have (way) to propose (??) speech,
I know there are many autoatic measures for summarisation so if we like just put those <ehm> in the proposal <ehm> (no one we) question?
[PERSON27] <ehm> I kind of don't know what to say.
[PERSON27] you wanted to discuss something?
[PERSON27] <ehm> <parallel_talk> Yeah, so – <parallel_task> so, <ehm> what I wanted to discuss <ehm> is probably <ehm> the format of the basic sample trial.
But this is – I think we should read (with) this – that format before [PERSON2] <ehm> appears and discuss it with [PERSON2].
my – my point of how to create basic samples should be discussed with [PERSON2] before we <ehm> go on.
wh- when [PERSON2] appears <ehm> I will discussed – <ehm> discuss with him, if his annotation tool can work with the (??) samples,
[PERSON55] As for the data format I'm already clear, like it's what we discussed like the three – three sections in each (file).
[PERSON27] Yes, meta-data and dashes, dashes is important.
[PERSON55] I think for this we are okay, but we didn't have time in the morning to discuss about some other details, like <ehm> anonymisation of – anonymi- anonymisation of the names of this annotators.
You (will keep) a list, where (Zac) is like (Zac) what – I don't know is her name and then you put annot01, as a (sample) example.
[PERSON27] Yes, I know, but st-
[PERSON27] Who – who does all that Github <ehm> things?
[PERSON55] From (zac) – from (zac) you will put annot01, like anonymise the name.
[PERSON55] Yes, sure, before pushing.
[PERSON27] Yes, this is clear.
[PERSON27] Perfect, so this is okay, yes.
[PERSON27] This is what I like.
[PERSON55] Yes, I told you, annot01 is like –
[PERSON27] Yes, yes, in this case it is a (??), so nw my task is to rename the files.
I mean, I also propose some other things but you didn't have time to discuss them, so, I'm not sure –
so maybe it's better to set up another meeting, like today –
[PERSON55] Yes it would be very good.
[PERSON55] Probably, tomorrow morning or evenyou want today afternoon or some time?
[PERSON27] (??) meeting tomorrow morning.
[PERSON27] Yes, not today, I am already at home – <parallel_talk> <unrecognisable_speech> <parallel_talk>
[PERSON55] Yes, sure.
[PERSON55] Yes, sure.
[PERSON54] Yes, (??) something like the meeting of today, you were also present (??) –
the thing is that we have to like wait for [PERSON2] (??) to actually <ehm> (??) that – (??) this annotation tool composed (for new) (??) (idea).
[PERSON54] I think the meeting pass-
[PERSON54] <mmhm> Yeah, okay.
[PERSON54] ([PERSON55]), anything else you want to discuss?
I 'm not, you know, wanting is like, yes?
