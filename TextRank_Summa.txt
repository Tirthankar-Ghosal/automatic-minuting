[PERSON54] No, no, this is the same link you can find in the –
[PERSON27] <mmhm>, so (that's) –
[PERSON27] Yes. So this Zoom link will also – <ehm> will also function the next time we <ehm> have the coffee meeting.
[PERSON27] Perfect, I just –
[PERSON54] So, I – I wanted (to note) that –
[PERSON54] I – I – I want to know that how do you have (??)?
[PERSON27] <ehm> Okay.
[PERSON27] If I <ehm> –
[PERSON27] <ehm> Do we have some chat here?
[PERSON27] I also think –
[PERSON27] (One more) thing is – is that they want to make it <ehm> –
<ehm> So –
Because (??) ([PERSON7] seems that) Zoom meeting link, it is (obvious) the – like <unrecognisable_speech>
<ehm> But –
[PERSON54] Oh –
[PERSON54] <ehm> And then?
<ehm> Mostly I –
[PERSON54] So this is the – like – (??) by the participant, great.
[PERSON27] Yes. This is mostly – it – this is what was created by [PERSON7] <ehm> within our [PROJECT1] minutes – [PROJECT1] meetings.
[PERSON27] So there are <ehm> –
[PERSON54] Okay, so I would like to ask you now –
[PERSON27] This is just for what?
[PERSON27] <ehm> Yes, <ehm> we try to get original minutes from the minu- meeting organisers, but sometimes <ehm> it may be very short for example, for –
[PERSON27] And I put in –
[PERSON54] You put it (??).
[PERSON27] <ehm> Now it works the same, we din't – we didn't change it yet.
<ehm> So ([PERSON7]) proposes that annotators do that themselves.
[PERSON55] <ehm> Sorry to interupt you Anja, I think that [PERSON7] already decided not to include – not to <ehm> let them <parallel_talk> Yes.
[PERSON27] Yes, but after (??) –
[PERSON27] Well, well –
[PERSON55] (??) what you will –
[PERSON27] Not too long, but he- s kind of <ehm> –
[PERSON27] Probably (we should) –
[PERSON55] So, [PERSON27] –
[PERSON27] Not exclude this option for the moment, <ehm> but –
[PERSON55] Okay, so, [PERSON27], I – yeah I – so – so this is like you <unrecognisable_speech> to upload the minute (??) correct, so this is actually a (list) work for us.
[PERSON55] Like if the annotators up- upload the minute themselves, so –
[PERSON27] Actually I'm not really fine with that at the moment, because for me – <ehm> I should think it over and I didn't do it yet.
[PERSON55] I – I think the same [PERSON27], I absolutely agree with you.
[PERSON27] So probably let's – yes.
[PERSON54] So, <unrecognisable_speech> [PERSON27], so <ehm> – so <ehm> – let – [PERSON55] said in the morning –
[PERSON54] No, no.
[PERSON27] <ehm> (??), could I ask you, please, now, if you could write this very question very explicitly somewhere into – into the agenda.
[PERSON54] – Google doc.
[PERSON27] <mmhm> Well, I – <ehm> now I understand it.
So this is what – <ehm>
if you would ask [PERSON7] this question he would probably say that <ehm> (??) think about it and <ehm> make o <ehm> or invent the measure or metric for – for that.
[PERSON54] Do you think this alignment –
[PERSON54] First, alignment first, manual evaluation measure –
[PERSON27] Okay –
[PERSON27] <ehm> (??) I don't think about it.
[PERSON27] Because –
[PERSON54] So this –
[PERSON27] Rather <ehm> –
either think with [PERSON53] about <ehm> – about that or <ehm> think <ehm> with [PERSON53], [PERSON55] and [PERSON7], not me, I don't know.
[PERSON27] <ehm> Do we –
[PERSON27] How many what?
[PERSON54] How many – how many automatic measures have you  tried?<ehm>
[PERSON27] Let –
[PERSON55] <mmhm> No, it's not very subjective, it's like –
I – I – I got – I go- got the (multimission) of <ehm> the (??) meeting script, but still that is like the (??) that [PERSON7] <ehm> is targetting to achieve <ehm> would you be more objective?
[PERSON55] <ehm> Yes, I mean –
[PERSON54] Yeah, so <parallel_talk> So – <parallel_talk> if we – if we are like – if we are not able to come up with the alignment <ehm>, if we are not able to come up with the alignment based <ehm> manual evaluation measure, –
[PERSON54] We go with – we go with the (??), the <unrecognisable_speech>
[PERSON27] Okay, so may I – may I summarise it, please?
So <ehm> –
[PERSON27] So –
[PERSON54] <mmhm> Yes. Yes, so <ehm> – so the thing is that <ehm> my <ehm> <unrecognisable_speech> before November it would be difficult to come up with the alignment (this score), so <ehm> for the (past) shared task that we have (way) to propose (??) speech,
[PERSON55] So this – this –
[PERSON54] <ehm> I'm talking to you (??).
[PERSON27] <ehm> I kind of don't know what to say.
[PERSON27] <ehm> <parallel_talk> Yeah, so – <parallel_task> so, <ehm> what I wanted to discuss <ehm> is probably <ehm> the format of the basic sample trial.
But this is – I think we should read (with) this – that format before [PERSON2] <ehm> appears and discuss it with [PERSON2].
[PERSON27] So this –
my – my point of how to create basic samples should be discussed with [PERSON2] before we <ehm> go on.
And then I <ehm> –
wh- when [PERSON2] appears <ehm> I will discussed – <ehm> discuss with him, if his annotation tool can work with the (??) samples,
And <ehm>, as for the data format, this is also a point with [PERSON55] <ehm> – 
[PERSON55] As for the data format I'm already clear, like it's what we discussed like the three – three sections in each (file).
[PERSON55] So this is – I think this is the <ehm> –
[PERSON27] Yes, this is –
[PERSON55] Yes, sure, because – 
[PERSON27] But, yes yes, but –
[PERSON55] But I think this is a –
[PERSON55] I think for this we are okay, but we didn't have time in the morning to discuss about some other details, like <ehm> anonymisation of – anonymi- anonymisation of the names of this annotators.
[PERSON27] [PERSON55], lwt's do it –
<ehm> So, an I –
[PERSON27] So, now we are <ehm> looki-
[PERSON55] <ehm> No, we will keep both of them.
[PERSON27] Who – who does all that Github <ehm> things?
[PERSON27] Yes, yes –
[PERSON55] From (zac) – from (zac) you will put annot01, like anonymise the name.
[PERSON27] <ehm> When?
[PERSON27] So –
[PERSON27] Somebody –
[PERSON27] Yes, so this is – this is what –
[PERSON55] Yes, I told you, annot01 is like –
[PERSON55] yes, but before that I also have –
[PERSON55] [PERSON7] would be – better to have also [PERSON7],
So, I think [PERSON7] –
[PERSON27] So, just (??) –
[PERSON27] So <ehm> –
[PERSON55] So –
[PERSON27] I'll write him and you now and –
[PERSON55] Yes, try to – we try to catch him.
[PERSON55] 
[PERSON27] Yes, not today, I am already at home – <parallel_talk> <unrecognisable_speech> <parallel_talk>
[PERSON54] Yes, (??) something like the meeting of today, you were also present (??) –
the thing is that we have to like wait for [PERSON2] (??) to actually <ehm> (??) that – (??) this annotation tool composed (for new) (??) (idea).
[PERSON27] Could you – could it – could you please send it to [PERSON53]?
[PERSON27] No.
[PERSON55] <ehm> No, I mean I definitely – (with) definitely (??) with [PERSON7] to –
We cannot really discuss anything without [PERSON7], because <ehm> –
[PERSON27] You too.
